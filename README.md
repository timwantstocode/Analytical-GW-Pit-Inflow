# Analytical-GW-Pit-Inflow (Marinelli & Niccoli, 1998)
This program simulates pit into a rectangular area. It first calculates an effect (circular) radius of a rectangle (length x width)
The radius of influence is then calculated (Niccoli et al, 1998)
Flow into the pit is then calculated (Marinelli and Niccoli, 1998)
The following assumptions apply to this equation
- There is no groundwater flow between zones 1 and 2
##### Zone 1
- steady-state, unconfined, horizontal radial flow
- uniformly distributed recharge at the water table
- pit walls are approximated as a right circular cylinder
- initial static water table and groundwater flow are both horizontal
- groundwater flow to the pit is axially symmetric
##### Zone 2
- steady state flow to one side of a circular disk sink of constant and uniform drawdown
- hydraulic head is initially uniform throughout Zone 2.
- initial head is equal to the elevation of the initial water table in Zone 1
- disk sink has a constant hydraulic head equal to the elevation of the pit lake water surface
- flow to the disk sink is three-dimensional and axially symmetric
- materials are anisotropic, prinicipal directions for K are horizontal and vertical
